# MPS Arduino Project

This project was inspired by step nine of lab 1 from [this](https://github.com/mosser/sec-labs) repository.

The goal was to design a Domain Specific Language targeted at an Arduino board capable of reading sensors (i.e. a button) and sending output to some kind of actuator (i.e. an LED or buzzer).
