1. Compile the project with mvn clean package

2. Generate the C source files with mvn -q exec:java

    2a. The generated C code cannot be compiled with make, it includes some builtin Arduino functions

3. The generated sources are in the 'output' directory. Open main.c in the Arduino IDE

    3a. There is an issue with fsm.h. Replacing the '#include fsm.h' in main.c with the contents of fsm.h will get around this

4. Compile and upload to the Arduino
