Here are some examples of Lustre programs (see README files in each directory):

minus contains a very small verification program, together with an
      example of session. It may be the first example to try.

occ-watch is the complete program of a digital watch, with its interface
      in C. A Makefile builds the whole program.
		This version needs the compiler occ, wich is part of the
		esterel distribution (http://www-sop.inria.fr/meije/esterel/)

watch is the complete program of a digital watch, with a C interface
		suitable for the compilers provided in the lustre distribution
		(either lus2oc+poc or lus2ec+ec2c) 

uturn contains a complete verification program for the example illustrating
      our paper in SIGSOFT'91.

parity illustrates the use of arrays and recursive nodes.
