This directory contains the programs of the digital watch.

The directory LUSTRE_SRC contains the Lustre program.

The directory C_SRC contains the interface programs, in C.

The lustre program can be compile either with:
-ec2c: the naive c-code generator ec2c (just type make) 
-ec2oc then poc: the automata-based code generator (type make -f Makeoc)

WARNING: the c-compilation of the code generated by ec2oc+poc might take
a lot of time !!!

You will get the program "watch",
which takes as parameters 4 characters, corresponding to the 4 buttons of the 
watch. For instance, typing "watch iokl" calls the watch with

    . key "i" bound to upper left button
    . key "o" bound to upper right button
    . key "k" bound to lower left button
    . key "l" bound to lower right button

Type "q" to quit.

By default, the base time is the 1/10 of second.
